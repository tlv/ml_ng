# Machine Learning: Andrew Ng

These are some notes that I put together for myself when going through Andrew Ng's famous [Coursera class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?) on Machine Learning. 

I've also included a pdf that has some matrix calculus basics. I no longer remember if this was mentioned in the class or not, but I found it helpful.

Feel free to submit issues if you find any typos/errors in this (which I'm sure there are plenty of).
